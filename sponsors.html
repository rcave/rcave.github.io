                        <p>Probably one of our most asked questions is where on earth we got our name from, and why. Maggie’s hearing is just slightly off, particularly when it comes to being able to differentiate between like-sounds. During one of our mother-daughter debates, It sounded for all the world as though Katie was calling her a CakeHag….. it became a long running family joke. When it came time to name the business, CakeHag was the natural choice. Once in a rare while a person will complain about the name, but we know that at least they haven’t forgotten it!</p>

                        <h2><a class="sponLink" target="_blank" href="http://vayabags.com/">Vaya Bags</a></h2>
                        <p>Once upon a time there was a girl whose messenger bag broke. To her dismay stitches began to tear and holes began to form. Having places to go, people to see and things to bring with her she began the hunt for a new bag. It was a long and tiresome journey. She saw many bags, all fine and dandy, but too expensive! Being that she lived in Allston and had a low paying job none of these bags would do. She just could not afford them. She was forced to continue using her old bag with holes. She tried  to patch them up but many a times her belongings would fall through the holes as she biked down the streets of Boston. One day, a brilliant idea popped into her head. She would create her own messenger bag! She did have extensive sewing experience from years of making clothing. So off to the fabric store she went. She gathered her supplies, sat by the sewing machine and in a few hours her masterpiece was complete. A messenger bag with multiple pockets, waterproof fabric, easy release buckles and padded strap! Many village folk took a liking to her new bag and asked for her to make them one of their own. And so "Vaya bags" were born...
<br/>
<br/>
Vaya Bags are all handmade by Tianna Meilinger with the occasional help of her family and friends. As an environmental scientist Tia believes in reusing and recycling materials. That is why Vaya Bags are made from recycled canvas. The canvas used to make the bags is scrap and surplus material that is recycled from local sailboat factories. Tia also uses recycled bicycle tubes to make all of her bike tube gear.</p>

                        <p>Madagascar Educational Opportunities, Inc. is a new Texas non-profit corporation established to enable impoverished youth in rural Madagascar to attend high school.  The long distances with limited transportation between many farm families and urban secondary schools necessitates rural students purchasing room and board, a cash expenditure simply beyond the means of many families whose sole source of support is typically rice farming. This is in addition to the increasing costs of school fees and supplies. The purpose of Madagascar Educational Opportunities, Inc. is to provide funding to allow rural youth to subsist while attending urban high school.
<br/>
<br/>
The President of Madagascar Educational Opportunties, Inc., Amanda A. Brown, is an attorney who spent three years living in rural Madagascar as a Peace Corps volunteer during the period 2005-2008. For most of that time, she lived in Sendrisoa, a small town located between Ambalavao and Park Andringitra.  As is typical of small towns in Madagascar, Sendrisoa has a middle school but no high school, and Amanda became aware of the difficulties facing middle school students who wanted to continue their education through secondary school.  In addition to paying for school supplies and any applicable school fees as well as having to forego helping on their family farms, these children also needed to pay for transportation to the city and pay the costs of obtaining room and board near a secondary school.  Amanda gave money to four middle school students from Sendrisoa to enable them to attend secondary school.  All four successfully finished secondary school, a significant achievement in Madagascar enabling an occupation with substantially higher income than available as a farmer.  Of the four youths aided: one is currently attending a university, two are working as middle school French and English teachers, and the fourth teaches at a private Catholic elementary school. Amanda is convinced that providing a small stipend to struggling students can make an enormous difference in their lives, and since leaving Madagascar, she has wanted to have a project that provides such aid on a recurring basis. Madagascar Educational Opportunities, Inc. (MEO) has been formed in order to aid students from rural areas of Madagascar who would like to attend high school.
<br/>
<br/>
In September 2013, Amanda travelled to Madagascar to investigate potential arrangements for engaging local assistance in identifying potential beneficiaries, monitoring initial and continuing eligibility, and distributing stipends in small increments during the academic year.  She entered into discussions with representatives from a local nongovernmental organization called Ny Tanintsika. Ny Tanintsika has a partnership with a Scottish organization known as Feedback Madagascar (www.feedbackmadagascar.org), which provides funding for a large number of its development projects in Madagacar. Ny Tanintsika has been working in Madagascar for more than ten years. Amanda came to an agreement with Ny Tanintsika, whereby Ny Tanintsika will run the program in Madagascar.     The program has begun in three rural communes of Madagascar: Sendrisoa, Vohitsaoka, and Miaranarivo. In its first year, it received 75 applications for 25 places. All of the applicants were students who had completed middle school and wanted to attend high school, but who did not have enough money to do so. Amanda and Ny Tanintsika evaluated the applications separately, and then together formed a list of 25 students to enter the program. The decisions were made based upon a combination of need and merit. All selected students will begin their high school studies during the week of October 14.
<br/>
<br/>
In Madagascar, high school lasts three years. MEO would like to select an additional 25 students each year, while continuing to fund the students that have already begun high school. Thus, ideally next year we will sponsor fifty students (25 in their first year of high school and 25 in their second year), and the following year we would fund 75 students. MEO currently has sufficient resources to fund only 25 students per year, and thus in order to attain our goals we will need additional funding. The total cost of putting a single student through high school is approximately forty dollars per month (for ten months of the year). Approximately half of that goes to cover the students' living expenses and a portion of their school fees, while the remainder is used by Ny Tanintsika to meet with the students monthly, verify that the students remain in school, raise awareness about the program, distribute/collect applications, and keep careful accounting and administrative records. For about the cost of a night out, a donor can cover the entire cost of putting a student through high school for a month. If a donor can provide forty dollars per month for ten months per year, he/she can fully cover the cost of a student's high school education. All students will write one letter per semester describing their progress in high school, which will be available for donors to read. </p>
